  Needless to say, I keep her in check
  She was a bad bad, nevertheless (yeah)
  Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (ayy)
  Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (ayy)
  Needless to say, I'm keepin' her in check
  She was a bad bad, nevertheless
  Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
  Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
  Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
  Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
  Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
  Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
  Ooh, some things you just can't refuse
  She wanna ride me like a cruise
  And I'm not tryna lose
